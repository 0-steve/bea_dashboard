# bea_dashboard
Visualization dashboard for Bureau of Economic Analysis data

This is a follow up to the [BEA ETL](https://github.com/0-steve/bea_etl) repo, where data from BEA was extracted and stored into a DuckDB database. 

The app will be created using Dash & Plotly, and it will include data on the US population, employment, income, and consumer expenditures. Additional economic data will be added in the future.

## Dash

Dash is a python franework for web application and is suitable for visualization dashboards due to its integration with Plotly. It allows for easy to build, fully customizable, interactive applications to explore and analysis data.
